### User Perspective

6. **Check Election Status**
   - *Objective*: Allow the voter to determine if the election has commenced.
   - *Functional Specification*: Display a message indicating whether the election has begun or not. If started, provide the start and end timestamps of the election period.

7. **View Candidates**
   - *Objective*: Enable the voter to see the list of candidates for an informed decision.
   - *Functional Specification*: Display the names of all candidates along with their respective IDs.

8. **Cast Vote**
   - *Objective*: Enable the voter to submit their vote for a specific candidate.
   - *Functional Specification*: Provide a button or interface for the voter to select a candidate. Upon selection, process the vote.

9. **View Election Period**
   - *Objective*: Allow the voter to see the start and end timestamps of the election.
   - *Functional Specification*: Display the timestamp range for the election period.

10. **Receive NFT of Final Result**
    - *Objective*: Provide the voter with an NFT containing the final election results for verification.
    - *Functional Specification*: Upon concluding the election session through the 'End Election' action, the administrator will generate an NFT containing the election results. This NFT will then be minted and sent to the respective voterâ€™s wallet address.

## Development

### Solidity - Smart Contract

#### Introduction

In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of smart contract development using Solidity. We will be creating a Voting smart contract to facilitate the voting process and an NFT to keep track of the voting results.


#### Diagram - Flow chart

- Include a flow chart diagram to visualize the flow of the smart contract.
