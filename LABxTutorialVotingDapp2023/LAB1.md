## DEVELOPING ETHEREUM SMART CONTRACTS

We will start this hands-on development course with a smart contract that aims to solve a
problem of traditional centralized voting platforms.

### What is the problem?

Traditional centralized voting systems pose significant security risks and lack transparency. It's challenging to provide concrete evidence of their security measures. Moreover, a central authority can potentially manipulate results, eroding trust in the electoral process.


### What is the solution?

Integrating cryptocurrencies and smart contracts offers a robust solution to address these challenges. This approach empowers supporters by involving them directly in the development and decision-making processes of the projects they choose to back, ensuring transparency and security in the voting system.


### How will it work?

- **Administrator Role:** An administrator has the authority to initiate an election by specifying candidates, setting a defined time duration, and registering eligible voters. 

- **Voter Registration:** Registered voters are allowed to cast a single vote within the election period.

- **Dynamic Updates:** The administrator retains the flexibility to add candidates and adjust the voting duration as necessary, even after the election has started.

- **Timer Expiry:** Once the timer reaches zero, voting is automatically closed, preventing further participation.

- **End Election:** The administrator can formally conclude the election process, signaling that no more votes can be cast.

- **Result Minting:** After concluding the election, the administrator can initiate the "minting" process, creating unique NFTs for each voter. These NFTs will serve as proof of the winner of the election.

- **Election Reset:** The administrator can choose to reinitialize the election, starting a fresh cycle for a new round of voting.

- **Result Verification:** The NFT collection acts as an immutable record, providing a time-stamped, verifiable history of all transactions within the voting system.

This comprehensive system ensures transparency, security, and integrity throughout the entire voting process, bolstered by the use of NFTs to memorialize the results and actions taken.

### A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO SOME PROGRAMMING BASICS (SKIP, IF YOU HAVE SOME CODING EXPERIENCE)

#### Introduction to Command Line

Chances are, you're working on a computer powered by a Linux, Mac, or Windows Operating System. Mastering the command line is pivotal for the tasks ahead. While you may write your code in editors like Microsoft Visual Studio Code or use Remix for Solidity smart contracts, the command line is indispensable for executing and testing your programs, even on the Morpheus Labs Platform. It's a versatile tool, with one of its primary roles being to leverage the npm package manager for installing necessary packages.

If you're using Windows, you might want to consider using Ubuntu Linux on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for a smoother experience. WSL provides a Linux environment within your Windows system, greatly benefiting blockchain development.

- **For Linux**: Open the terminal. (Shortcut: CTRL+ALT+T)

- **For Windows (with Ubuntu on WSL)**: Launch the WSL terminal.

- **For Mac**: Utilize the terminal.

- **On Morpheus Labs SEED BPaaS**: Access the terminal. (Ubuntu docker)



#### Navigating your file system

When navigating your file system, keep these commands in mind:


- `cd ..`: Move up one directory level.
- `cd <folder name>`: Enter a specific folder.
- `ls`: List files and folders in the current directory.
- `ls -a`: List all files and folders, including hidden ones.
- `cat <file name>`: Display the contents of a file.
- `touch <file name>`: Create a new file.
- `mkdir <folder name>`: Create a new folder.
- `rm <file name>`: Remove a file (be cautious, this action is irreversible).
- `rm -r <folder name>`: Remove a folder and its contents.
- `mv <source> <destination>`: Move or rename files and folders.
- `cp <source> <destination>`: Copy files or folders.
- `pwd`: Display the current working directory.
- `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.
- `history`: Display a list of recently used commands.
- `grep <pattern> <file>`: Search for a specific pattern in a file.
- `chmod <permissions> <file>`: Change the permissions of a file.
- `nano <file name>`: Open the Nano text editor to edit a file.
- `wget <URL>`: Download a file from the internet.
- `curl <URL>`: Transfer data from or to a server.

Once you're in the desired folder, you can run your program by typing `<program name>` in the command line. NPM, a potent package manager, will be your go-to tool for installing, updating, and removing packages like Hardhat, ethers, Express...


#### Introduction to Basic Programming Concepts

##### Variables and Constants

In programming, variables and constants are essential components. They are used to store and manipulate data. 

- **Variables**: These are containers that can hold various types of data, such as strings, integers, or booleans (true/false). The value of a variable can be changed during the execution of a program.

    ```javascript
    let name = "John"; // Here, 'name' is a variable storing a string value "John".
    let age = 30;      // 'age' is a variable storing an integer value 30.
    let isStudent = true; // 'isStudent' is a variable storing a boolean value true.
    ```

- **Constants**: Unlike variables, constants hold fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program.

    ```javascript
    const PI = 3.14; // Here, 'PI' is a constant with a fixed value of 3.14.
    const MAX_SIZE = 100; // 'MAX_SIZE' is a constant with a fixed value of 100.
    ```

##### Data Structures

Understanding data structures is crucial for efficient data management in programming. Here are some common data structures:

- **Array**: An array is defined within square brackets `[]`. It can hold multiple values, each separated by commas. 

    ```javascript
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // 'numbers' is an array containing five integers.
    let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]; // 'names' is an array containing three strings.
    ```

- **Object (Dictionary)**: An object is defined within curly braces `{}`. It consists of key-value pairs, where each piece of data is mapped to a specific value. 

    ```javascript
    let person = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
        isStudent: false
    }; // 'person' is an object with name, age, and isStudent as keys and their respective values.
    ```

##### Functions

Functions play a vital role in programming. They take input values, process them, and return a result. Functions are defined with a name, input parameters within parentheses `()`, and the code to be executed within curly braces `{}`. 

They can be called by using the function name and providing the necessary input values. 

```javascript
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

let result = addNumbers(5, 3); // 'result' will be 8.
```

##### Classes

Classes are fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP). They encapsulate data and functions into a single unit. A class can contain multiple functions that define the behavior of objects created from that class.

Keep this informations at hand for the next configuration of Metamask.

##### Notes for later:
Then, into **Lab4**, at final stage of the development we will migrate to the **Sepolia** network with ChainID **11155111** (0xaa36a7) and currency ETH. This setup will simulate the Ethereum mainnet for testing purposes. 

To accomplish this, you need to modify the ChainID value in both the frontend script and the .env file within the Hardhat configuration. Additionally, update the hardhat.config.js file to include the new ChainID, as well as adjust the RPC URL and the private key associated with the deployer account into .env file.

## Set up the main dapp repository

To get started with our decentralized voting application tutorial, we'll first set up the main repository. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Folder

Open a terminal and execute the following commands to create a new folder for our project:

```bash
mkdir voting-dapp-tutorial
cd voting-dapp-tutorial
touch README.md
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This will create a new directory named `voting-dapp-tutorial` and a `README.md` file, which will serve as the main documentation for our project. Additionaly this will initialise Git for our project.

### Step 2: Install HardHat

Next, we'll install HardHat, a popular development environment for Ethereum. HardHat provides a set of tools that make it easy to compile, deploy, and test smart contracts. Execute the following command to install HardHat:

```bash
mkdir hardhat    // this will create a hardhat folder
cd hardhat       // this will make you move into hardhat folder
npx hardhat init // this will initialise hardhat and create a folder structure
```

This command will fetch and set up the HardHat environment in our project directory.

In the dialogue box of hardhat:
- Create a JavaScript project - YES
- Confirm root folder location - ENTER
- Add gitignore - YES
- install dependencies with npm (hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox)- YES

#### Verify HardHat installation
```
npx hardhat --version
```


With these initial steps completed, we're now ready to proceed with the creation of our smart contract for the decentralized voting system. Let's move on to the next section!

## Creating the `Voting.sol` smart contract with Solidity

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of creating the `Voting.sol` file, which will house the smart contract for our decentralized voting application. This Solidity file will define the behavior and rules of our voting system on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Step 0: Create a file named Voting.sol in hardhat/contract folder
With vscode web interface:
- navigate to voting-dapp-tutorial-2023/hardhat/contracts
- create a new file named Voting.sol

or with the terminal:

```bash
cd hardhat/contracts
touch Voting.sol
```

### Step 1: Set the Compiler Version and Import Dependencies


- At the top of the file, specify the License type (SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED)
- Then specify the compiler version pragma solidity (pragma solidity ^0.8.22;)
- Then import any necessary dependencies. In our case, we're importing the `ElectionNFT.sol` (not yet created) contract, which will handle the creation of unique NFTs for each voter.
- Finaly write the name of the contract and open curly braces {}

Your file should looks like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.22; // Specifies the compiler version

import "./ElectionNFT.sol"; // Import the future NFT contract

contract Voting {
    // ... (content of the Voting.sol contract will be added later)
}

```

---

### Step 2: Define the Contract Structure

Within the `Voting.sol` file, we'll outline the fundamental structure of our smart contract. This involves declaring variables, creating functions, and implementing modifiers. The entire content of the contract will be placed within the curly braces `{}`.

```solidity
contract Voting {
    // Declare variables
    address public electionNFTContract;

    // Define data structures, modifiers, and events

    struct Candidate {
        uint256 id;
        string name;
        uint256 numberOfVotes;
    }

    uint256 public electionID = 0;
    Candidate[] public candidates;
    address public owner;

    // Define access modifiers
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        // Modifier code to restrict access
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    modifier electionOnGoing() {
        // Modifier code to check if election is ongoing
        require(block.timestamp >= votingStartTimeStamp && block.timestamp <= votingEndTimeStamp, "Election is not ongoing");
        _;
    }

    // Define events
    event ElectionStarted(
        address indexed owner,
        uint256 startTimestamp,
        uint256 endTimestamp
    );

    event CandidateAdded(
        uint256 indexed candidateId,
        string name
    );

    // ... (more events)

    // Define functions
    function startElection(string[] memory _candidates, uint256 _votingDuration) 
        public 
        onlyOwner 
    {
        // Function code to start an election
        require(_candidates.length > 0, "At least one candidate is required");
        require(electionNFTContract != address(0), "ElectionNFT contract address not set");

        // Initialize election variables
        electionID++;
        votingStartTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
        votingEndTimeStamp = block.timestamp + _votingDuration;

        // Create candidates
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _candidates.length; i++) {
            candidates.push(Candidate({
                id: i,
                name: _candidates[i],
                numberOfVotes: 0
            }));

            emit CandidateAdded(i, _candidates[i]);
        }

        emit ElectionStarted(owner, votingStartTimeStamp, votingEndTimeStamp);
    }

    // ... (more functions)

}
```

In this step, we've defined the basic structure of the `Voting.sol` contract. We've declared variables for essential components, defined a `Candidate` struct, implemented access modifiers for security, and created events for key occurrences. Additionally, we've started the implementation of the `startElection` function, which initializes the election and creates candidate entries.

---

## Step 3: Implementing the Voting System Logic part 1

In this step, we will dive into the actual implementation of the decentralized voting system. This encompasses defining essential data structures, setting up administrator roles, managing candidates, registering voters, and orchestrating the entire voting process.

### Defining Data Structures

We begin by defining the necessary data structures that will facilitate the functioning of our voting system.

```solidity
contract Voting {
    address public electionNFTContract;

    // Define data structures, modifiers, and events

    struct Candidate {
        uint256 id;
        string name;
        uint256 numberOfVotes;
    }

    uint256 public electionID = 0;
    Candidate[] public candidates;
    address public owner;
    // ... (more variables)
}
```

Here, we've declared a `Candidate` struct to represent each individual in the election. It includes an ID, a name, and a count of their received votes. Additionally, we have variables like `electionID`, `candidates`, and `owner` that will be crucial throughout the process.

### Setting Access Modifiers

Access modifiers are essential for controlling who can execute certain functions. We'll use modifiers to restrict access to specific actions.

```solidity
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        // Modifier code to restrict access
    }

    modifier electionOnGoing() {
        // Modifier code to check if election is ongoing
    }
```

The `onlyOwner` modifier ensures that certain functions can only be executed by the contract owner. The `electionOnGoing` modifier verifies if an election is currently in progress.

### Declaring Events

Events in Solidity allow smart contracts to communicate information to external consumers. We'll define events to signal important occurrences in our voting system.

```solidity
    event ElectionStarted(
        address indexed owner,
        uint256 startTimestamp,
        uint256 endTimestamp
    );
    // ... (more events)
```

For instance, the `ElectionStarted` event will be emitted when a new election commences, providing details like the owner's address and the start/end timestamps.

### Implementing Functions

We'll create functions to perform crucial tasks, such as initiating an election, registering voters, casting votes, and more.

```solidity
    function startElection(string[] memory _candidates, uint256 _votingDuration) 
        public 
        onlyOwner 
    {
        // Function code to start an election
    }

    // ... (more functions)
```

The `startElection` function, for instance, allows the owner to start a new election by specifying candidate names and the voting duration.

---

## Step 4: Implementing the Voting System Logic in `Voting.sol` part 2

Now that we've set up the basic structure of our decentralized voting system in `Voting.sol`, it's time to delve into the actual logic that governs the election process. In this step, we'll be adding functions and features that handle candidate management, voter registration, voting, and more.

### Managing Candidates

In our smart contract, each candidate is represented by a `Candidate` struct. This struct includes essential details such as an ID, name, and the number of votes received.

```solidity
struct Candidate {
    uint256 id;
    string name;
    uint256 numberOfVotes;
}
```

We have implemented functions to facilitate the addition and removal of candidates, allowing for flexibility even during an ongoing election. Additionally, these functions provide the capability to reset the election session, facilitating the creation of a new election process when needed.

```solidity
function addCandidate(string memory _name) public onlyOwner electionOnGoing {
    // ... (Function code to add a new candidate)
    emit CandidateAdded(candidates.length - 1, _name);
}

function removeCandidate(uint256 _candidateId) public onlyOwner {
    // ... (Function code to remove a candidate)
}
```

### Voter Registration and Voting

The voting process involves ensuring that each voter can only cast one vote. We track voters through the `voters` mapping and verify eligibility using the `eligibleVoters` mapping.

```solidity
mapping(address => bool) public voters;
mapping(address => bool) public eligibleVoters;

// ... (other mappings and variables)

function registerVoter(address _eligible_voter) public onlyOwner {
    // ... (Function code to register an eligible voter)
}

function voteTo(uint256 _id) public electionOnGoing {
    // ... (Function code to cast a vote)
    emit VoteCast(msg.sender, _id);
}
```

### Election Management

The contract provides functionality to start, end, and reset elections. The owner can also extend the duration of an ongoing election.

```solidity
function startElection(string[] memory _candidates, uint256 _votingDuration) public onlyOwner {
    // ... (Function code to start a new election)
    emit ElectionStarted(owner, votingStartTimeStamp, votingEndTimeStamp);
}

function endElection() public onlyOwner electionOnGoing {
    // ... (Function code to end the current election)
    emit ElectionFinished(owner);
}

function resetElection() public onlyOwner {
    // ... (Function code to reset the election)
    emit ElectionReset(owner);
}

function changeElectionDuration(uint256 _newDuration) public onlyOwner electionOnGoing {
    // ... (Function code to change the duration of the ongoing election)
    emit ElectionDurationChanged(_newDuration);
}
```

### Winner Determination and NFT Minting

The contract determines the winner based on the candidate with the highest number of votes. Additionally, it supports minting NFTs for voters and participants.

```solidity
function getWinnerInfo() public view returns (Winner memory) {
    // ... (Function code to determine the winner)
}

function mintResultNFTs(string memory _tokenURI) public onlyOwner {
    // ... (Function code to mint NFTs for all voters)
}

function mintResult(address _participant, string memory _tokenURI) public onlyOwner {
    // ... (Function code to mint an NFT for a specific participant)
}
```

### Election Metadata

The `generateMetadata` function provides essential metadata about the election.

```solidity
function generateMetadata() public view returns (ElectionMetadata memory) {
    // ... (Function code to generate metadata)
}
```

This marks the completion of the implementation of the voting system logic in our `Voting.sol` contract. In the next step, we'll proceed to explore additional features like handling candidate removal and examining the final results.

---

## Step 5: Managing Candidates and Reviewing Results

### Handling Candidate Removal

In a dynamic voting system, the ability to remove candidates is crucial. We'll add functionality to remove a candidate, updating the state and ensuring a fair and accurate representation of the election.

```solidity
function removeCandidate(uint256 _candidateId) public onlyOwner electionOnGoing {
    // ... (Function code to remove a candidate)
    emit CandidateRemoved(_candidateId);
}
```

This function allows the owner to remove a candidate during an ongoing election, triggering the `CandidateRemoved` event.

### Reviewing Final Results

Once the election concludes, it's essential to review the final results. The contract provides functions to retrieve winner information and overall election metadata.

```solidity
function getWinnerInfo() public view returns (Winner memory) {
    // ... (Function code to determine the winner)
}

function generateMetadata() public view returns (ElectionMetadata memory) {
    // ... (Function code to generate metadata)
}
```

These functions provide a comprehensive overview of the election results, including the winner and additional metadata.

### Emitting Events for Transparency

To ensure transparency and accountability, we emit events throughout the process. Events such as `CandidateRemoved` and `ElectionFinished` provide a clear record of actions taken.

```solidity
event CandidateRemoved(uint256 indexed candidateId);
event ElectionFinished(address indexed owner);
// ... (other events)
```

These events serve as a transparent log of significant occurrences within the contract.

### CREATING THE ElectionNFT.SOL FILE


In this section, we'll guide you through the process of creating the `ElectionNFT.sol` file, which will handle the creation of unique NFTs for each voter in our decentralized voting application.

Create a new file named `ElectionNFT.sol` and paste the following code:

It's a good start for the explanation of the `ElectionNFT.sol` file. However, you can provide more details and context for each part of the code to ensure that your audience, especially those new to blockchain and smart contracts, can understand the purpose and functionality of each component. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the code and additional explanations you can include:

### CREATING THE ElectionNFT.SOL FILE

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of creating the `ElectionNFT.sol` file, which will handle the creation of unique NFTs for each voter in our decentralized voting application.

#### Code Explanation:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";

contract ElectionNFT is ERC721 {
    address public electionContractAddress;
    uint256 public electionId;
    uint256 private tokenIdCounter;
    string private baseTokenURI;
    mapping(uint256 => string) private tokenURIs;
```

- **SPDX-License-Identifier:** Specifies the license type under which the code is released. In this case, it's set to "UNLICENSED," indicating that the code doesn't have a specific license.

- **Solidity Version:** Indicates the compiler version the code is compatible with (Solidity version 0.8.22 in this case).

- **Importing ERC721:** This contract inherits from the ERC721 standard, which is the Ethereum standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It provides the basic functionality needed for NFTs.

- **Variables:**
  - `electionContractAddress`: Stores the address of the election contract that interacts with this NFT contract.
  - `electionId`: Represents the unique identifier for the election.
  - `tokenIdCounter`: Keeps track of the unique token IDs minted.
  - `baseTokenURI`: Stores the base URI for token metadata.
  - `tokenURIs`: Maps token IDs to their respective token URIs.

#### Constructor:

```solidity
    constructor(address _electionContractAddress) ERC721("Election NFT", "ENFT") {
        electionContractAddress = _electionContractAddress;
    }
```

- **Constructor:** Initializes the NFT contract with the name "Election NFT" and the symbol "ENFT." It also sets the `electionContractAddress` to the provided address.

#### Base URI Function:

```solidity
    function _baseURI() internal view virtual override returns (string memory) {
        return baseTokenURI;
    }
```

- **Base URI Function:** Overrides the internal `_baseURI` function from the ERC721 standard. It returns the base URI for all token metadata.

#### Set Base Token URI Function:

```solidity
    function setBaseTokenURI(string memory _newBaseTokenURI) external {
        require(msg.sender == electionContractAddress, "Only the election contract can set base URI");
        baseTokenURI = _newBaseTokenURI;
    }
```

- **Set Base Token URI Function:** Allows the election contract to set the base URI for token metadata. This is essential for generating unique token URIs.

#### Mint NFT Function:

```solidity
    function mintNFT(address _to, string memory _tokenURI) external {
        require(msg.sender == electionContractAddress, "Only the election contract can mint NFTs");
        _safeMint(_to, tokenIdCounter);
        tokenURIs[tokenIdCounter] = _tokenURI;
        tokenIdCounter++;
    }
```

- **Mint NFT Function:** Enables the election contract to mint a new NFT for a specified address (`_to`). It uses `_safeMint` from the ERC721 standard and associates the new token ID with the provided token URI.

#### Get Token URI Function:

```solidity
    function getTokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (string memory) {
        return tokenURIs[_tokenId];
    }
}
```

- **Get Token URI Function:** Allows external parties to retrieve the token URI associated with a specific token ID. (This is generaly the URL of already uploaded metadata on IPFS.)

#### Conclusion:

In conclusion, the `ElectionNFT.sol` file defines a contract that complements the main voting contract by handling the creation and management of unique NFTs for each voter. These NFTs serve as a transparent and verifiable record of each voter's participation in the election.
