## DEVELOPING ETHEREUM SMART CONTRACTS

We will start this hands-on development course with a smart contract that aims to solve a
problem of traditional centralized voting platforms.

### What is the problem?

Traditional centralized voting systems pose significant security risks and lack transparency. It's challenging to provide concrete evidence of their security measures. Moreover, a central authority can potentially manipulate results, eroding trust in the electoral process.


### What is the solution?

Integrating cryptocurrencies and smart contracts offers a robust solution to address these challenges. This approach empowers supporters by involving them directly in the development and decision-making processes of the projects they choose to back, ensuring transparency and security in the voting system.

### How will it work?

### How will it work?

- **Administrator Role:** An administrator has the authority to initiate an election by specifying candidates, setting a defined time duration, and registering eligible voters. 

- **Voter Registration:** Registered voters are allowed to cast a single vote within the election period.

- **Dynamic Updates:** The administrator retains the flexibility to add candidates and adjust the voting duration as necessary, even after the election has started.

- **Timer Expiry:** Once the timer reaches zero, voting is automatically closed, preventing further participation.

- **End Election:** The administrator can formally conclude the election process, signaling that no more votes can be cast.

- **Result Minting:** After concluding the election, the administrator can initiate the "minting" process, creating unique NFTs for each voter. These NFTs will serve as proof of the winner of the election.

- **Election Reset:** The administrator can choose to reinitialize the election, starting a fresh cycle for a new round of voting.

- **Result Verification:** The NFT collection acts as an immutable record, providing a time-stamped, verifiable history of all transactions within the voting system.

This comprehensive system ensures transparency, security, and integrity throughout the entire voting process, bolstered by the use of NFTs to memorialize the results and actions taken.

### ELEMENTS OF THE APP

#### Variables:

- `electionNFTContract`: Address of the ElectionNFT contract.
- `electionID`: Unique identifier for each election.
- `candidates`: Array holding candidate details, including their ID, name, and the number of votes received.
- `owner`: Address of the contract owner.
- `voters`: Mapping of voter addresses to their voting status.
- `eligibleVoters`: Mapping of addresses eligible to vote.
- `ListOfVoters`: Internal list of addresses who have participated in the election.

- `votingStartTimeStamp`: Timestamp when the voting period starts.
- `votingEndTimeStamp`: Timestamp when the voting period ends.
- `electionStarted`: Status indicating if an election is in progress.

- `endElection()`: Function to conclude an ongoing election.
- `removeCandidate(_candidateId)`: Function to remove a candidate from the list.
- `removeAllCandidates()`: Function to remove all candidates.
- `transferOwnership(newOwner)`: Function to transfer ownership of the contract.
- `changeElectionDuration(_newDuration)`: Function to change the duration of the ongoing election.
- `addCandidate(_name)`: Function to add a new candidate.
- `registerVoter(_eligible_voter)`: Function to register a voter.
- `registerVoters(_eligible_voters)`: Function to register multiple voters.
- `mintResultNFTs(_tokenURI)`: Function to mint NFTs for election results.
- `mintResult(_participant, _tokenURI)`: Function to mint an NFT for a participant.
- `setElectionNFTContract(_electionNFTContract)`: Function to set the address of the ElectionNFT contract.

- `getWinnerInfo()`: Function to get information about the winner of the election.
- `generateMetadata()`: Function to generate metadata for the election results.

### A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO SOME PROGRAMMING BASICS (SKIP, IF YOU HAVE SOME CODING EXPERIENCE)

#### Introduction to Command Line

Chances are, you're working on a computer powered by a Linux, Mac, or Windows Operating System. Mastering the command line is pivotal for the tasks ahead. While you may write your code in editors like Microsoft Visual Studio Code or use Remix for Solidity smart contracts, the command line is indispensable for executing and testing your programs, even on the Morpheus Labs Platform. It's a versatile tool, with one of its primary roles being to leverage the npm package manager for installing necessary packages.

If you're using Windows, you might want to consider using Ubuntu Linux on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for a smoother experience. WSL provides a Linux environment within your Windows system, greatly benefiting blockchain development.

- **For Linux**: Open the terminal. (Shortcut: CTRL+ALT+T)

- **For Windows (with Ubuntu on WSL)**: Launch the WSL terminal.

- **For Mac**: Utilize the terminal.

- **On Morpheus Labs SEED BPaaS**: Access the terminal. (Ubuntu docker)

When navigating your file system, keep these commands in mind:

- `cd ..` to move up one level.
- `cd <folder name>` to enter a specific folder.

Once you're in the desired folder, you can run your program by typing `<program name>` in the command line. NPM, a potent package manager, will be your go-to tool for installing, updating, and removing packages like Hardhat.
