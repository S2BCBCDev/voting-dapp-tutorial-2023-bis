## Setting Up the Frontend

In this section, we will guide you through setting up the frontend of your Voting dApp. Follow these steps to create the necessary folders and files:

### 1. Create a Frontend Folder

Begin by creating a folder named `frontend` within your project directory. This folder will house all the files related to the frontend of your dApp.

### 2. Create a Public Folder

Inside the `frontend` folder, create a subfolder named `public`. This folder will hold any publicly accessible files, such as HTML and images.

### 3. Create HTML and JavaScript Files

Within the `public` folder, create the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will serve as the entry point of your web application. You can use this file to structure the layout of your dApp's user interface.

```html
<!-- Add your HTML code here -->
```

- `script.js`: This JavaScript file will contain the client-side code that interacts with the smart contracts and updates the UI based on user actions.

```javascript
// Add your JavaScript code here
```

### 4. Set Up a Server (Optional)

If your dApp requires server-side functionality, create a file named `server.js` in the `frontend` folder. This file will handle any backend logic your application may need.

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

To securely manage sensitive information, it's best practice to use environment variables. Create a file named `.env.example` in the root directory of your project. This file will serve as an example template for your environment variables. Include any placeholders or default values that your application requires.

Here's an example of how you can structure your `.env.example` file:

```plaintext
# This is the URL of the Ethereum RPC provider
RPC_URL="https://example.com/rpc"

# This is a private key for signing transactions
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"

# This is an API key for accessing a specific service
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# This is the chain ID for the Ethereum network
CHAIN_ID=12345

# This are the addresses of smart-contracts
CONTRACT_ADDRESS='0x1234567890abcdef'
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS='0x1234567890abcdef'
```

# Blockchain & Solidity Lab4 – Voting dApp Development

### S2BC

### Lab 4: Run a dApp and Consider Next Steps
- BUILD / TEST / INTEGRATE / **RUN**

---

So far, you've followed the steps in Labs 1 to 3, gaining valuable insights into the core components of blockchain development. Now, in Lab 4, we will discuss crucial considerations for running a dApp and planning for its future contributions.

## 1. Store Only Essential Data on the Blockchain

When designing your dApp, it's important to be mindful of data storage on the blockchain. Storing large volumes of data on-chain can be expensive. Evaluate which data should reside on the blockchain and which should be stored off-chain.

## 2. Considerations About Data Migration

Upgrading your dApp is inevitable, but remember that the blockchain is an immutable database. This means that smart contracts cannot be modified after deployment. It's crucial to separate data from business logic to mitigate data migration challenges.

## 3. Manage Block Gas Limit

On the Ethereum network, the block gas limit is a critical factor to consider. Transactions requiring more gas than the limit won't be successful. While code might run smoothly on local private chains, it might fail on the public chain. Be cautious of this potential discrepancy.

## 4. Keep Smart Contracts Simple

The blockchain software ecosystem is evolving rapidly, and debugging can be challenging. It's advisable to keep your smart contracts concise and straightforward to minimize the likelihood of encountering bugs.

## 5. Ensure Data Consistency

In a multi-node environment, particularly in private or public chains, consider data consistency. Transactions take time to synchronize between nodes, potentially leading to inconsistencies. Design your dApp logic with data state in mind.

## 6. Prepare for Unexpected Network Situations

When using public chains like Ethereum main network, be aware that transactions may fail or experience significant delays during network congestion. Be prepared to handle such scenarios.

### Uploading Your dApp to the Application Library

Once your dApp is developed and tested, you have the option to upload it to the MorpheusLabs SEED platform's Application Library. This allows you to share your dApp with a wider audience and potentially earn MITx tokens.

Follow these steps to upload your dApp:

1. Access the Application Library menu.
2. Click on the "Upload New App" button.
3. Select the appropriate deployment type (Source Code, Compiled, or External) based on your dApp's stage.

### Deployment Types:

#### Source Code:
Suitable for development and testing versions (aka dev).

#### Compiled:
Suitable for staging and production versions (aka prod).

#### External:
Suitable for featuring your application with AppLibrary.

For detailed steps on uploading your dApp, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.morpheuslabs.io/docs/submit-app-to-the-app-store).

## notes
It might be helpful to provide some resources or tips on how to monitor and analyze the performance of a deployed dApp, especially in a real-world scenario.

Consider including a section on deploying a dApp on a testnet first before deploying it on the mainnet, to allow for thorough testing in a controlled environment.
