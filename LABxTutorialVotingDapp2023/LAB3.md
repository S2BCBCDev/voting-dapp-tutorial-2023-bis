# Blockchain & Solidity Lab3 â€“ Voting dApp Development

### S2BC

### Lab 3: Integrate Web App with Smart Contracts
- BUILD / TEST / **INTEGRATE** / RUN

---

**Objective:** The aim of this Lab3 is to integrate the smart contracts you developed in Lab1 and Lab2 with a Voting dApp for users to access the dApp using the web browser.

## Setting Up the Frontend

In this section, we will guide you through setting up the frontend of your Voting dApp. Follow these steps to create the necessary folders and files:

### 1. Create a Frontend Folder

Begin by creating a folder named `frontend` within your project directory. This folder will house all the files related to the frontend of your dApp.

### 2. Create a Public Folder

Inside the `frontend` folder, create a subfolder named `public`. This folder will hold any publicly accessible files, such as HTML and images.

### 3. Create HTML and JavaScript Files

Within the `public` folder, create the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will serve as the entry point of your web application. You can use this file to structure the layout of your dApp's user interface.

```html
<!-- Add your HTML code here -->
```

- `script.js`: This JavaScript file will contain the client-side code that interacts with the smart contracts and updates the UI based on user actions.

```javascript
// Add your JavaScript code here
```

### 4. Set Up a Server (Optional)

If your dApp requires server-side functionality, create a file named `server.js` in the `frontend` folder. This file will handle any backend logic your application may need.

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

To securely manage sensitive information, it's best practice to use environment variables. Create a file named `.env.example` in the root directory of your project. This file will serve as an example template for your environment variables. Include any placeholders or default values that your application requires.

Here's an example of how you can structure your `.env.example` file:

```plaintext
# This is the URL of the Ethereum RPC provider
RPC_URL="https://example.com/rpc"

# This is a private key for signing transactions
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"

# This is an API key for accessing a specific service
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# This is the chain ID for the Ethereum network
CHAIN_ID=12345

# This are the addresses of smart-contracts
CONTRACT_ADDRESS='0x1234567890abcdef'
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS='0x1234567890abcdef'
```

### General Tips:
- Provide clear explanations for each function or action, including its purpose and potential use cases.
- Include comments in the code to explain complex logic or any specific considerations.
- Encourage students to test each functionality with different inputs to gain a better understanding.
- Consider adding error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations.

## notes
Provide an example of how to handle user authentication in the web app, especially if it involves interacting with Ethereum accounts.

Consider adding a section on user interface design principles to help students create an intuitive and user-friendly voting interface.
