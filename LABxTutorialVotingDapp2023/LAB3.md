### Lab 3: Integrate Web App with Smart Contracts
- BUILD / TEST / **INTEGRATE** / RUN

---

**Objective:** The aim of this Lab3 is to integrate the smart contracts you developed in Lab1 and Lab2 with a Voting dApp for users to access the dApp using the web browser.

---

### Deploy Compiled Smart Contract with Hardhat

To deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain network, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Configure a dotenv (.env) file

First, install the `dotenv` package using the following command:

```bash
npx install dotenv
```

Next, create a `.env` file in the root folder of your HardHat project. This file will contain sensitive information that should be kept secure. Add the following variables to the `.env` file:

```dotenv
# This is the URL of the Ethereum RPC provider
RPC_URL="https://example.com/rpc"

# This is a private key for signing transactions
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"

# This is an API key for accessing a specific service
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# This is the chain ID for the Ethereum network
CHAIN_ID=12345

# This is the address of a smart contract (optional)
CONTRACT_ADDRESS='0x1234567890abcdef'
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

#### Step 2: Configure hardhat.config.js

Modify your `hardhat.config.js` file as follows:

```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.20",
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      chainId: 11155111,
      url: process.env.RPC_URL,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  },
  paths: {
    artifacts: "./src/artifacts",
    contracts: './src/contracts',
  }
};
```


#### Step 3: Create a New Deployment Script

Create a new file named `deploy.js` inside the `hardhat/scripts` directory. Add the following content to the file:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");
const fs = require('fs');

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);
  const votingContract = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Voting");
  const deployedVotingContract = await votingContract.deploy();

  const deploymentInfo = `Deployer Address: ${deployer.address}\nContract Address: ${deployedVotingContract.address}`;

  console.log(`Voting Contract Address deployed: ${deployedVotingContract.address}`);
  fs.writeFileSync('deploymentInfo.txt', deploymentInfo);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

To deploy the contract, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

The result output from the terminal will provide the contract addresses.

A "deploymentInfo.txt" file will be created with the contract addresses.

---

#### Step 3-bis: Create a New Deployment Script for ElectionNFT contract

Next, deploy the ElectionNFT contract using the address of the previously deployed contract.

Create a new file named `deploy2.js` inside the `hardhat/scripts` directory. Add the following content to the file:

```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");
const fs = require('fs');

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying ElectionNFT contract with the account:", deployer.address);

  const electionNFTContract = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("ElectionNFT");
  const deployedElectionNFTContract = await electionNFTContract.deploy("<FIRST CONTRACT ADDRESS>");

  console.log(`ElectionNFT Contract Address deployed: ${deployedElectionNFTContract.address}`);

  const deploymentInfo = `Deployer Address: ${deployer.address}\nContract Address: ${deployedElectionNFTContract.address}`;

  console.log(`ElectionNFT Contract Address deployed: ${deployedElectionNFTContract.address}`);
  fs.writeFileSync('deploymentInfoNFT.txt', deploymentInfo);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

Remember to replace `<FIRST CONTRACT ADDRESS>` with the address of the first contract deployed (check `deploymentInfo.txt`).

#### Verify contracts

If you've added your Etherscan API key, you'll be able to verify the contracts using the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat verify <FIRST CONTRACT ADDRESS> --network sepolia
```

# Frontend integration
### Setting Up the Frontend

In this section, we will guide you through setting up the frontend of your Voting dApp. Follow these steps to create the necessary folders and files:

### 1. Create a Frontend Folder

Begin by creating a folder named `frontend` within your project directory. This folder will house all the files related to the frontend of your dApp.

Your tree folder should be like:
```
- voting-dapp-2023
   - hardhat
   - frontend
```
So if you were in hardhat folder, come back to your root folder:
```
cd ..
```
then create the frontend folder

```
mkdir frontend
cd frontend
```

### 2. Let's initiate Node.js

```
npm init -y
```
That will create a package.json file into your frontend folder.

### 2. Then install Express.js
```
npm install express
```

Now your package.json file should like like this:
```
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

That is where you can add more dependencies if needed in the futur.

You have two way to add dependencies:
- use of "npm install express"
or
- add a line "express": "^4.18.2" to the package.json file



### 2. Set Up a Server by creating a server.js file

If your dApp requires server-side functionality, create a file named `server.js` in the `frontend` folder. This file will handle any backend logic your application may need.

Create a server.js file and add thoses lines:

```
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'public', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});

```

To test out of the server works you can run:

```
npm start
```

You should get this terminal output:

```
npm start

> frontend@1.0.0 start
> node server.js

Server is running on http://localhost:3000
```

and then be abble to open your explorer and check http://localhost:3000
if the server is runing.

### 2. Create a Public Folder

Inside the `frontend` folder, create a subfolder named `public`. This folder will hold any publicly accessible files, such as HTML and images.

```
mkdir public
cd public
```

### 3. Create HTML and JavaScript Files

Within the `public` folder, create the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will serve as the entry point of your web application. You can use this file to structure the layout of your dApp's user interface.

```html
<html>
Server is Up
</html>
```

- `script.js`: This JavaScript file will contain the client-side code that interacts with the smart contracts and updates the UI based on user actions.

```javascript
// JavaScript code will be here
```

A this point your folder structure should looks like that:
```
- voting-dapp-2023
  - hardhat
  - frontend
    - server.js
    - public
      - index.html
      - script.js
```        



### 5. Configure Environment Variables

#### Install Dotenv dependencies
Come back to the frontend folder:

```
cd ..
```
then
```
npm instal dotenv
```

To securely manage sensitive information, it's best practice to use environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.





Here's an example of how you can structure your `.env` file:

```plaintext
# This is the URL of the Ethereum RPC provider
RPC_URL="https://example.com/rpc"

# This is a private key for signing transactions
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"

# This is an API key for accessing a specific service
API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# This is the chain ID for the Ethereum network
CHAIN_ID=12345

# This are the addresses of smart-contracts
CONTRACT_ADDRESS='0x1234567890abcdef'
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS='0x1234567890abcdef'
```

---

### Frontend Folder Structure

```
  - frontend
    - server.js
    - public
      - index.html
      - script.js
    - .env
```
