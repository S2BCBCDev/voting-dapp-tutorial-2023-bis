# Blockchain & Solidity Tutorial Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Blockchain & Solidity Tutorial! This comprehensive tutorial is designed to provide you with a hands-on learning experience in blockchain development using Solidity, JavaScript, and other essential tools. Whether you're a second-year university student in Munich or an aspiring blockchain developer, this tutorial will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to start developing your own decentralized applications (dApps).

## About the Tutorial

This tutorial is divided into four labs, each focusing on a specific aspect of blockchain and Solidity development. From setting up your development environment to integrating web applications with smart contracts, you'll embark on a step-by-step journey to become proficient in blockchain technology.

### **Lab 1 - Developing Ethereum Smart Contracts**

In this lab, you'll learn the fundamentals of Ethereum smart contract development. We'll cover everything from problem-solving with smart contracts to understanding key programming concepts. By the end of this lab, you'll have developed essential smart contracts for your dApp.

### **Lab 2 - Testing Ethereum Smart Contracts with Hardhat**

Testing is a critical aspect of blockchain development. In this lab, you'll dive into testing your Ethereum smart contracts using the powerful Hardhat framework. You'll learn how to write effective test cases to ensure the reliability and security of your contracts.

### **Lab 3 - Integrate Web App with Smart Contracts**

Now that you've mastered smart contract development and testing, it's time to bring your dApp to life! In this lab, we'll guide you through integrating your smart contracts with a user-friendly web application. You'll learn how to create an interactive interface for users to interact with your dApp.

### **Lab 4 - Run a dApp and Consider Next Steps**

Congratulations on reaching the final lab! Here, we'll discuss crucial considerations for running a dApp and planning for its future contributions. You'll learn about data storage, data migration, gas limits, and more. Plus, we'll guide you on how to share your dApp with a wider audience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.js, CSS, and HTML. Familiarity with blockchain concepts is a plus but not required.

Now, let's dive into Lab 1 and start building your first Ethereum smart contracts!
